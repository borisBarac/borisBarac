## 👋 Hi, I'm Boris
**Native Mobile Expert turned AI Engineer.**

I drive technical innovation by fusing emerging tech with rock-solid engineering principles. My current obsession is **Agentic Workflows**—figuring out how to make AI reliable enough for production. Whether I'm fine-tuning a model, writing Terraform scripts, or polishing a Swift UI, my goal is the same: shipping high-quality, modern software.
