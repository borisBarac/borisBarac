### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Welcome to my GitHub

I am a software engineer, my main focus is on mobile technologies.
<br>At the moment I am mostly focused on finding good ways to increase code reusability, robustness, and quality of large code bases through modularization and automation. I am also a lazy developer who loves finding ways to do more with less, and this is currently quite an interesting topic, especially with the growth of the number of devices we run our apps on.
<br>Big fan of **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Serverless**. In my opinion, both are great ways to move faster and increase developer engagement both on FE and BE.

Feel free to check out my pinned projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently mostly working with [Swift](https://www.swift.org), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).
- ðŸ¤– playing around with AI and loving [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and general best practices around serverless development
