### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Welcome to my GITHUB

I am software engineer, my main focus is on mobile technologies.
<br>At the moment i am mostly focused on finding good ways to increase code reusability, robustness and quality of large code bases through modularization and automation. I am also a lazy developer who loves finding ways how to do more with less, and this is currently quite an interesting topic especially with growth of number of devices we run our apps on.
<br>Big fan of **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Serverless**. In my opinion both are great ways to move faster and increase developer engagement both on FE and BE.

Feel free to check out my pinned projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently mostly working with [Swift](https://www.swift.org), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and general best practices around serverless development
